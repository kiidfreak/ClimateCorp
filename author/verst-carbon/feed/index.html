										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">In the face of global warming, the role of legislation in climate change mitigation cannot be overstated. A case in point is Kenya&#8217;s Climate Change (Amendment) Bill 2023, an ambitious piece of legislation that aims to plug gaps and enhance participation in carbon markets. This landmark amendment is not only a step in the right direction for Kenya, but it could also serve as a blueprint for other African countries looking to bolster their climate change strategies.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A Closer Look at the Amendment</h3>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">The Climate Change (Amendment) Bill 2023, proposed by the Ministry of Environment, Climate Change, and Forestry, offers several key improvements to Kenya&#8217;s existing environmental regulations. The proposed amendment represents an effort to ratify the Climate Change Act 2016 and to address any existing gaps within it.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">The amendment proposes the development, management, implementation, and regulation of mechanisms to enhance climate change resilience, low-carbon development, and sustainable development in Kenya.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">Some of the clauses that stood out for us in the amendment include:</p>



<ol class="has-white-color has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background">
<li><strong>The Focus on Carbon Markets and Inclusive Benefit-Sharing Mechanisms</strong></li>
</ol>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">The proposed amendment lays emphasis on the role of carbon markets. It provides a mechanism for public and private entities to transfer and transact emission reduction units, mitigation outcomes, or offsets generated through carbon initiatives, programmes, and projects​​. The Bill&#8217;s provision for benefit-sharing mechanisms in carbon markets ensures that the benefits of climate change initiatives are equitably distributed. This approach can serve as a model for other African countries, encouraging them to ensure that both public and private entities are appropriately rewarded for their efforts toward mitigating carbon emissions.</p>



<ol start="2" class="has-white-color has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background">
<li><strong>Alignment with International Goals</strong></li>
</ol>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">By aligning with the goals of the Paris Agreement, Kenya demonstrates its commitment to international climate change objectives. Not only does this foster shared responsibility and collective action to tackle global issues like climate change, but it also allows African countries to tap into international funding and technology transfers. These resources help them implement sustainable strategies and increase their resilience against climate change impacts.</p>



<ol start="3" class="has-white-color has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background">
<li><strong>Embracing Nature-Based Solutions</strong></li>
</ol>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">One of the standout aspects of this amendment is its focus on nature-based solutions to address climate change, human health, food and water security, and disaster risk reduction effectively. It underscores the importance of actions to protect, sustainably manage, or restore natural ecosystems, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits​​.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">The bill also seeks to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, enhance forest carbon stock at national and sub-national levels, and includes activities that reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the sustainable management of forests and the conservation and enhancement of forest carbon stocks.</p>



<ol start="4" class="has-white-color has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background">
<li><strong>Public Participation</strong></li>
</ol>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">The Kenyan government&#8217;s approach of inviting public comments and inputs on the proposed amendment emphasizes the role of citizens in shaping the country&#8217;s environmental policy. This strategy encourages public ownership of climate change policies and fosters a collective responsibility towards environmental conservation.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">Kenya’s Ministry of Environment, Climate Change, and Forestry set a deadline of May 26, 2023, for public participation. Virtual public meetings were held between May 10 and May 24, 2023, to discuss the proposed amendment and receive input from the public. We are pleased to add that we at <a href="https://verst.earth/">Verst Carbon</a> also submitted our views on the proposed Climate Change Amendment Bill and are awaiting the ratification of the bill. This inclusive approach ensures that the views of all stakeholders are taken into consideration in the development of climate change policies.</p>



<ol start="5" class="has-white-color has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background">
<li><strong> Fostering Public and Private Sector Collaboration</strong></li>
</ol>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">A key aspect of the proposed amendment is the involvement of both the public and private sectors in the implementation of non-market approaches. These approaches aim to promote mitigation and adaptation ambition, enhance public and private sector participation in the implementation of nationally determined contributions, and enable opportunities for coordination across instruments and relevant institutional arrangements​​.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">Moreover, the Act will allow public and private entities to participate in carbon markets, fostering the transfer and transaction of emission reduction units, mitigation outcomes, and offsets generated through various initiatives, programs, and projects.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A Model for African Countries</h3>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">The proposed Climate Change (Amendment) Bill 2023 represents a significant step forward in Kenya&#8217;s climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. By incorporating nature-based solutions, engaging both the public and private sectors, and promoting public participation, Kenya is setting a holistic and inclusive blueprint for other nations on the continent. The success of this bill could pave the way for similar initiatives across the continent, driving Africa towards a more sustainable and resilient future in the face of climate change.</p><p>The post <a href="https://verst.earth/kenyas-proposed-climate-change-bill-amendment-a-blueprint-for-african-countries/">Kenya’s Proposed Climate Change Bill Amendment: A Blueprint for African Countries?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://verst.earth">Verst Carbon</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The Verified Carbon Standard, Verra, a global leader in developing and managing standards for carbon credits and other environmental commodities, recently conducted [&#8230;]</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://verst.earth/what-next-after-verras-consultation-with-blockchain-players/">What next after Verra’s consultation with blockchain players?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://verst.earth">Verst Carbon</a>.</p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">The Verified Carbon Standard, Verra, a global leader in developing and managing standards for carbon credits and other environmental commodities, recently conducted a <a href="https://verra.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Verras-Approach-To-Third-Party-Crypto-Instruments-And-Tokens-Public-Consultation-Summary-of-Comments-1.pdf">consultation on its approach to third-party crypto instruments and tokens</a>. The consultation, which ran from 3 August to 1 November 2022, received input from 71 stakeholders, including industry groups, project proponents, professional developers, corporate buyers, environmental organizations, and the general public.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">Verra <a href="https://verra.org/verra-addresses-crypto-instruments-and-tokens/">prohibited the practice of creating instruments or tokens</a> based on retired credits (tokenization of carbon credits) in May 2022. This was done to give the registry ample time to consult stakeholders and set up systems for “immobilizing” credits in accounts in the Verra Registry so that they can be tokenized with the transparency and traceability that market participants demand, prevent fraud and uphold environmental integrity.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">Verra’s consultation with stakeholders sought input on three main topics: measures to associate verified carbon units (VCUs) with crypto instruments or tokens, know your client (KYC) requirements, and amendments to the registry terms of use relating to anti-fraud. In summary, stakeholders provided the following main points of feedback on the three topics:</p>



<ol class="has-vivid-green-cyan-color has-text-color">
<li>Measures to associate VCUs with crypto instruments or tokens</li>
</ol>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">The first topic focused on the creation, transfer, and use of VCU-backed crypto instruments and tokens, and the safeguards that should be implemented by Verra to ensure environmental integrity, particularly to prevent double-issuance and double-use.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">Stakeholders proposed several measures to ensure environmental integrity, such as tokenizing platforms undergoing rigorous security and accounting audits, embedding metadata into carbon tokens, and using digital measurement, reporting, and verification tools. To prevent double-issuance, stakeholders suggested embedding metadata about the underlying VCU into each carbon token and depositing metadata/hashes of each carbon token into the Verra Registry. To prevent double-use, stakeholders proposed immobilizing VCUs used to generate carbon tokens in the Verra registry and using a trust structure where Verra maintains control over the carbon tokens and holds them in trust for the beneficial owner.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">In terms of infrastructure and processes, some stakeholders were not keen on immobilization at all. However, others proposed a form of linkage between the Verra Registry and the blockchain on which the carbon tokens are issued, a specialized account set up in the Verra Registry to hold immobilized VCUs, and technological/automated solutions to link the Verra Registry with the platform.</p>



<ol start="2" class="has-vivid-green-cyan-color has-text-color">
<li>Know your client (KYC) requirements</li>
</ol>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">The second topic focused on the KYC checks that should be applied to platforms before authorizing them to issue, market, and/or transact in crypto instruments or tokens that are backed by VCUs.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">Stakeholders suggested two broad categories of KYC checks for platforms. The first category consisted of corporate KYC checks to ascertain the financial standing of the platform, as well as to check for the involvement of sanctioned entities and to run general anti-money laundering checks. The second category of KYC checks is related specifically to the processes and technical operations of the platforms, including cybersecurity audits, information about the processes and carbon footprint of the blockchain and the platform, licenses from local authorities to operate a platform, and the platform&#8217;s own KYC policies</p>



<ol start="3" class="has-vivid-green-cyan-color has-text-color">
<li>Amendments to the registry terms of use relating to antifraud</li>
</ol>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">On the third topic, stakeholders proposed several amendments to the Registry Terms of Use (TOU) related to anti-fraud considerations for the association of third-party crypto instruments and tokens with VCUs. Most respondents either did not respond or did not propose any text, instead making general comments on what should be included in the TOU.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">These include adding a section in TOU for the approval of Authorized Tokenization Platforms, specifying that the Verra Registry shall take priority over the approved platform in cases of conflict, and stating that Verra is the sole authority capable of reactivating VCUs. Additionally, stakeholders proposed that project proponents should promise to accept a public ID allocated by Verra, use it in communications and blockchain interactions, and ensure that emission reductions can no longer be transacted and become property of the buyer.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">WAY FORWARD</h3>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">Based on the feedback received during the consultation, it seems that Verra will need to consider implementing a range of measures to safeguard the environmental integrity of VCU-backed crypto instruments and tokens. These measures include implementing safeguards to prevent double-issuance and double-use, such as embedding metadata into carbon tokens and linking the tokens to the actual performance of a project. Additionally, Verra will need to consider the infrastructure and processes needed for entities participating in the immobilization approach, such as setting up a specialized account in the Verra Registry to hold immobilized VCUs and possibly creating a digital public ledger built on blockchain technology to record all transactions of Carbon Tokens.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">Verra will also need to consider implementing KYC requirements for platforms before authorizing them to issue, market, and/or transact in crypto instruments or tokens that are backed by VCUs. This includes both corporate KYC checks to ascertain the financial standing of the platform and anti-money laundering checks, as well as process and technical KYC checks such as cybersecurity audits, information about the processes and carbon footprint of the blockchain and the platform, and licenses from local authorities to operate a platform.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">In terms of amendments to the Registry Terms of Use relating to anti-fraud, Verra will need to consider textual amendments to address anti-fraud considerations related to the association of third-party crypto instruments and tokens with VCUs. This could include clauses such as Verra being the sole authority capable of reactivating VCUs, Verra&#8217;s registry taking priority over the approved platform in cases of conflict, and a declaration that only Carbon Tokens that have real VCUs as collateralized assets are deemed valid for trading purposes on the approved platform.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-text-color">Ultimately, this consultation is expected to result in clarity from Verra on the best and approved practices for players providing blockchain-based solutions in carbon markets. Other registries like <a href="https://www.goldstandard.org/blog-item/comment-blockchain-better-untangling-tokenisation-and-carbon-markets">Gold Standard</a> have also shown interest in incorporating blockchain-based players in their ecosystems, a positive development for the growing number of climate start-ups that have integrated blockchain technology in their solutions.</p><p>The post <a href="https://verst.earth/what-next-after-verras-consultation-with-blockchain-players/">What next after Verra’s consultation with blockchain players?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://verst.earth">Verst Carbon</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>
